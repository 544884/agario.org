        body : '<p>Every once in a while, a game comes along that grabs ahold of the Internet and refuses to let go. These games don’t appear nearly as frequently as they used to, back before digital downloads of full PC games were the norm, but Cookie Clicker is one of the modern examples of how even the most simplistic Flash game can still be a huge hit.</p><p>This week, a new game has staked its claim. That game is Agar.io.</p><p>In Agar.io, you are a cell. Your goal is to collect pellets around the map in order to grow in size while avoiding other players who are bigger than you. If another, larger player catches you, they will consume your cell and you’ll have to start from scratch.</p><p>Other than collecting pellets and avoiding bigger cells, you can also press the space bar to split your cell in half, sending one half flying forward in order to capture a fleeing cell (or to save yourself from an imminent threat).</p><p>The game is free to play at Agar.io, but the team is already hard at work on a full Steam version, which you can vote for on Steam Greenlight right now. The full version is expected to feature more game modes, a skin editor, account stats and other stuff you won’t find in the browser version. It’s also going to be free to play.</p><p>via <a href="https://bgr.com/2015/05/04/agar-io-browser-game-addictive/">BRG</a></p>'

        body : '<p>Controlling your blob is about as intuitive as it can get. You start out a tiny little blob, flying around the agar at high-speed.</p><h2>Some facts</h2><ul><li>You pick up “skittles” (as I like to call them) to grow in size. Each skittle gives you 1 point in mass.</li><li>The bigger your mass, the slower you are able to move.</li><li>The more pieces you are in, the more zoomed out the map is, and the further off you will be able to see blobs that want to eat you. Of course, the smaller your blobs are, the more easily you are eaten.</li><li>The space bar key divides yourself in half. One half shoots forward, the other backwards a little. This is great for getting out of tight situations and also eating other blobs.</li><li>After a minute or so of being in smaller pieces, your pieces will go together to form a big blob again.</li><li>You can eat other blobs that are smaller than you. There are two ways:</li><li>Without dividing: you must be at least 10% bigger in diameter (and hence slower) so you have to somehow pin the smaller blob into a corner, virus, or a bigger blob.</li><li>By hitting space bar and dividing yourself in two, you can shoot forward and nab the smaller blob. The blob you’re shooting half of your mass at must be less than ~1/3 your original mass, or you’ll go through it or worse yet, be eaten.</li><li>The W key shoots out mass. You can use this to feed your friends, temporarily lighten your mass to move faster, or feed the “viruses” (the green spiked circles).</li><li>The green viruses pop larger blobs into many tiny little pieces.</li><li>The green viruses are fed by the ejecting mass into them. After being fed 7 times, they shoot a second green virus out. The projecting virus goes in the direction of the last blob added to it. Viruses are good for popping large blobs.</li><li>The only moderation that names have is that they’re limited to 14 characters. For some reason, the people who choose to play agar tend to choose fairly graphic names. There’s an option to have “no names” in the settings menu if you don’t like seeing profanity.</li><li>If you want to have a “skin”, choose one of these names. They are automatically applied.</li><li>Also there are mods allowing you to connect to the same server are your friends (agar.io mod). I haven’t done this personally.</li><li>You can’t be split into more than 16 pieces. This means that once you’re in 16 pieces, if you’re big enough to pop a virus, it will actually feed you and make you bigger without cutting you up more. Check out the gif here.</li><li>There is no sound in Agar.io. This means you can talk with your friends, listen to podcasts, or jam to electronic dance music while scooting around eating other blobs smaller than you.</li></ul><p>I began to wonder how the game was balanced, since the skittles appear to spawn continuously. At first I expected the blobs to grow bigger and bigger forever. I later realized that big blobs have attrition and slowly shrink, making the total mass of the system constant. This also means that once you become big, you can’t just sit around – you have to keep working, eating other people, to stay on top.</p><p>Soon, you notice the other players…. Some are friendly!</p><h2>How do people act in this game?</h2><p>Some people have names that try to be friendly- “love>hunger” “let’s team up” etc. Since there’s really no way to communicate, expect betrayal without hesitation, especially from larger blobs. You can depend on smaller blobs to be nice, since they have no way of hurting you.</p><p>CORRECTION: Steve (from the comments): “I noticed that people DO team up, by prefixing their name with a team name (eg, [UOA] or [HKG]). Team members help to feed smaller members, defend split members, and help to rejoin split members (by eating half of them then feeding the mass back in). Teams do far better than lone wolves.</p><p>Of course, I managed to take advantage of this by giving myself a team name with Chinese characters and leaching from their team’s gifts…”</p><p>Sometimes, people team up randomly (example here). Whenever I play, though, I have trouble when teaming up with other people, especially because if one of you is bigger, because it’s pretty easy to accidentally eat each other.</p><p>Apparently there’s some competitive agar.io players in the CIA? Awesome!</p><p>When I noticed the scoreboard, I quickly decided that I needed to become #1. This is the only reason I kept playing more than 15 minutes.</p><p>I like to keep a timer going, to see how much time I’m investing in the game, and also to evaluate how long each strategy is taking.</p><p>When at the menu screen, make sure you enable mass count in the options menu. It’ll help you keep track of how big you are.</p><p>The basic idea is to take advantage of the foolish people trying to take risks to get ahead faster.</p><h3>Mass = 0-200</h3><p>The fastest way to do this is to collect as many dots as quickly as possible, using the shortest distance between dots. It’s kind of like how my 3d printer prints – it never wastes time jumping long distances, but computes the perfect way to get the job done as quickly as possible. This is obvious, but if you think “what path can I take to collect the most dots the quickest”, you will probably go 20-30% faster.</p><p>200 might seem like a pretty high mass to collect from dots, but it takes about 2 minutes, and it is much less risky than trying to split yourself to capture a smaller blob.</p><h3>Mass = 200-300</h3><p>Take it easy. It took you a couple minutes to get this far, and you are the perfect food. You will get shot at by anyone ~3x bigger than you (since they can use spacebar). It’s risky, but if you see someone who’s 1/3 the size of you, you can shoot at them, but you’re probably best off just taking it easy for a little longer, just collecting the colored dots.</p><p>Every time you screw up, you’ll have to restart, forcing you to spend 2 minutes running around picking up the goddamn skittles again.</p><p>Once you’re above 300, the basic idea is that you need to hit spacebar and eat blobs 1/3 your size, while avoiding the blobs that are 3x your size. Once you’re split in two, avoid the big blobs and let yourself grow back together before trying it again. Remember that you can see more of the screen when you’re in smaller pieces. Don’t split into more than 2 pieces unless you know you are 100% safe.</p><h3>High-risk strategy</h3><p>Hang around a bunch of really aggressive big blobs shooting the green viruses at each other. You can capitalize when one of them releases a bunch of small blobs, and quickly gain lots of mass.</p><h3>Low-risk strategy</h3><p>Find an abandoned corner and slowly work your way up to mass = 500. Eat the small blobs that come along.</p><p>One of the coolest moves you can do is to find two blobs lined up and eat them both in one shot. The closer one should be less than 1/3 your size. Then, if you hit space bar and swallow the small close blob, you will increase in size, and be able to engulf the second blob, too (even if it’s larger). It’s like hitting a combo and is really fun if you can pull it off!</p><p>Once you reach ~500 or so, you can start to roam more. I don’t recommend attempting shooting green viruses at big blobs until you’re ~1,000, since it wastes a lot of mass.</p><p>During this time, there’s a lot of intense slow-speed chases. Avoid getting trapped (by corners of the map, or by the green viruses), keep the green viruses between you and the other blobs, and you’ll most likely be fine. The advantage is that the smaller you are, the faster you are. As long as you keep clear of the people 3x as big as you, they can’t shoot at you, and you’ll most likely survive.</p><p>The most important part of strategy is to keep track of what you’re doing, how successful it is, and how you can alter your strategy next time you play.</p><h2>Applications to real life</h2><p>QuitLoL’s mission is to promote high standards for the games you choose to play. I firmly believe there is not much point to playing a game that has no relevance to real life, no matter how much fun it is. I think, with some embellishment, that I can apply parts of Agar.io to reality.</p><p>Playing this game for an hour or so will test your quick decision making and your judgement of risk. You are repeatedly tested on whether or not you can grow from pouncing on somebody else, or be sucked up by a passing blob if you make the wrong call. This is moderately stimulating of the brain. If you don’t play strategy much, you might get some benefit from playing it for a while.</p><p>If you are trying to get into the top ten, your odds of success are greatly improved if you come up with a good strategy. By observing the behavior of other blobs, you can quickly take advantage of their mistakes to make yourself bigger. This requires attention to detail, using your memory, and long-term planning.</p><p>What can we learn about human behavior? In a game with no communication, selfishness runs rampant and teamwork is impossible. Some people even had the name “ctrl+w to chat” or “F5 to zoom out”, which is actually the hot key to close your tab, ending the game, and allowing them to eat your disconnected blob. Also, people chose names that are sometimes quite derogatory, most likely for attention. Since there’s no feedback, the game promotes selfishness.</p><p>How about addictive potential? Agar.io doesn’t have the life-destroying horrendous time-sucking addiction potential that LoL has. However, it’s still tempting to waste your evening clicking like a madman and hollering when BALLMAN69 comes out of nowhere and eats you whole. It’s tempting to spend a lot of time to get really good at agar.io when things in real life aren’t going as well. Make sure you keep your priorities in good order and only play agar.io for an hour or so before moving on to something more productive and important.</p><p>Sometimes in life, you have high aspirations to do something amazing. You want to take on a huge big project. But the fastest way to get there isn’t to take on all at once. You’ve got to slowly “grow your blob”, learn skills, understand the rules, and obtain some good experience before you can take a big risk. Of course, if you don’t reflect on the game, you’d completely miss this message.</p><p>In some ways, Agar.io is a simulation of the animal kingdom. The blobs eat the “grass”, and the bigger blobs eat the little blobs, and it all works together to create the circle of life! Keep thinking about these bigger concepts while you play – it feeds your creativity and stretches your mind.</p><p>via <a href="http://quitlol.com/agar-io-experience-strategy-application-real-life/">QuitLoL</a></p>'
